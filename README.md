### Settings files

This repository contains a large number of configuration files for setting the parameters of the various tools used.

Normally, for the purposes of your project, you won't need to modify these files, except for `.env` and `requirements.txt`.


## :arrow_forward: Install required packages

- [ ] In Git Bash, run the following commands to:
  - install all packages from file `requirements.txt`
  - list all packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip list
```


## :arrow_forward: Environment variables

You are now going to define environment variables to declare the database and webservice to which you are going to connect your python application.

At the root of the project :

- [ ] Create a file called `.env`
- [ ] Paste in and complete the elements below

```default
WEBSERVICE_HOST=https://pickpoker.com/api

POSTGRES_HOST=sgbd-eleves.domensai.ecole
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DATABASE=idxxxx
POSTGRES_USER=idxxxx
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=idxxxx
POSTGRES_SCHEMA=projet
```


## :arrow_forward: Unit tests

- [ ] In Git Bash: `pytest -v` 
  - or `python -m pytest -v` if *pytest* has not been added to *PATH*


### TU DAO

To ensure tests are repeatable, safe, and **do not interfere with the real database**, we use a dedicated schema for unit testing.

The DAO unit tests use data from the `data/pop_db_test.sql` file.

This data is loaded into a separate schema (projet_test_dao) so as not to pollute the other data.


### Test coverage

It is also possible to generate test coverage using [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.4.0/index.html)

:bulb: The `.coveragerc` file can be used to modify the settings

- [ ] `coverage run -m pytest`
- [ ] `coverage report -m`
- [ ] `coverage html`
  - Download and open coverage_report/index.html



## :arrow_forward: Launch the CLI application

This application provides a very basic graphical interface for navigating between different menus.

- [ ] In Git Bash: `python src/main.py`
- [ ] On first launch, choose **Reset database**
  - this calls the `src/utils/reset_database.py` program
  - which will itself execute the SQL scripts in the `data` folder



## :arrow_forward: Launch the webservice

This application can also be used to create a webservice.

- [ ] `python src/app.py`

Documentation :

- /docs
- /redoc

### Endpoints

Examples of endpoints (to be tested, for example, with *Insomnia* or a browser):


- `GET http://localhost/joueur`
- `GET http://localhost/joueur/3`
- ```
  POST http://localhost/joueur/
  JSON body :
    {
      "pseudo": "patapouf",
      "mdp": "9999",
      "age": "95",
      "mail": "patapouf@mail.fr",
      "fan_pokemon": true
    }
  ```
- ```
  PUT http://localhost/joueur/3
  JSON body :
    {
       "pseudo": "maurice_new",
       "mdp": null,
       "age": 20,
       "mail": "maurice@ensai.fr",
       "fan_pokemon": true
    }
  ```
- `DELETE http://localhost/joueur/5`



## :arrow_forward: Logs

It is initialised in the `src/utils/log_init.py` module:

- This is called when the application or webservice is started.
- It uses the `logging_config.yml` file for configuration.
  - to change the log level :arrow_right: *level* tag

A decorator has been created in `src/utils/log_decorator.py`.

When applied to a method, it will display in the logs :

- input parameters
- the output

The logs can be viewed in the `logs` folder.

Example of logs :

```
07/08/2024 09:07:07 - INFO     - ConnexionVue
07/08/2024 09:07:08 - INFO     -     JoueurService.se_connecter('a', '*****') - DEBUT

```



## :arrow_forward: Continuous integration (CI)

The repository contains a `.github/workflow/main.yml' file.

When you *push* on GitHub, it triggers a pipeline that will perform the following steps:

- Creating a container from an Ubuntu (Linux) image
  - In other words, it creates a virtual machine with just a Linux kernel.
- Install Python
- Install the required packages
- Run the unit tests (only the service tests, as it's more complicated to run the dao tests)
- Analyse the code with *pylint*
  - If the score is less than 7.5, the step will fail

You can check how this pipeline is progressing on your repository's GitHub page, *Actions* tab.
